## Fast and Simple program to Switch between Steam Accounts

### How does it work?
1. It lists the usernames you have added in the ListBox
2. Ends all running Steam processes
3. It edits "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\AutoLoginUser" to your selected username, and also sets the RememberPassword DWORD to True.

- It ends any processes that start with "Steam", and then restarts Steam.exe once the switch is made.
